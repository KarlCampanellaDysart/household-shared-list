# household-shared-list

Household is a IOS application that I built for my sister as a present because I didn't have any money to buy her something real. In short, it is a shared notifications list based on location. A user can add or take away from a few different categories of lists if they have access to that account. A user can discover accounts based on their location. The idea is that if your are in someone's house, they can share certain information with you without actually telling you anything.

I used core location and the apigee API sdk for objective-c to store data in a NoSQL like database.
